# crem (c reminders)

A continuation of my `*rem` series of programs.  
This is my first real program written in C, and my goal was at first to just get it working,  
as I thought that was challenging enough, but as time went on I kept upping the portability  
aspect until I reached the ANSI/C89/C90 standard. I tried to make it as portable as possible  
but do keep in mind, this is my first C program, there are bound to be horrendous bugs  
sprinkled in. In all of my testing at the end, I haven't been able to crash it. I'm sure that  
someone more experienced can tear all of my code apart and explain all the undefined behavior  
that I haven't been able to catch.
